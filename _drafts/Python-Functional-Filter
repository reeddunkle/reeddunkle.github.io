The `filter()` method is a way to filter through an [iterable](http://reeddunkle.github.io/Python-Iterables-Iterators/), using a boolean function as a sieve. It constructs a new iterable, filled with the elements from the original iterable that pass the criterion of your boolean function.

It's a quick, easy way to test every element in your iterable against a certain criterion -- those that pass are passed on to the output, those that fail are left out.

### Exercise 5: Make a custom filter

I've found that making my own versions of built-in methods helps me understand the built-in methods a lot better. You should try to do it:

**Instructions**

 - Build a function called `my_filter` that takes a boolean function, and a list as parameters, and which returns a new list consisting of the elements from the original list for which that boolean expression is `True`.
 - Set `numbers = range(1, 100)`
 - Print the result of calling `my_filter` with a [lambda function](http://reeddunkle.github.io/Python-Lambda-Closures/) that filters the elements in `numbers` which are divisible by two
