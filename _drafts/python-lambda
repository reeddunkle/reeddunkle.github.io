In Python, anonymous functions are declared with the `lambda` keyword.

### How to use lambdas:

Refer to the following:

```python
add_two_numbers = lambda x, y: x + y

print(add_two_numbers(10, 3))  # => 13
```

Note that I am setting the variable `add_two_numbers` to be the lambda function itself..

The variables that follow the `lambda` declaration are the functions parameters.
The resolution of the actions that follow the colon is its return value.

Written as a normal function, this would be:

```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
  return x + y
  
add_two_numbers = add_numbers  # To follow the process above
print(add_two_numbers(10, 3))  # => 13
```

Because the return value of a lambda isn't explicit, it's useful to see how they are commonly used.

#### Lambdas as a boolean expression

Boolean expressions are one of the most common cases of lambdas.

```python
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
print(is_even(4))  # => True
print(is_even(3))  # => False
```

```python
is_longer_than_5 = lambda s: len(s) > 5
name1 = "Reed"
name2 = "Reedworth"

print(is_longer_than_5(name1))
print(is_longer_than_5(name2))
```
