This is the repo for my blog.

I moved to NYC in April, 2016 to attend the Recurse Center for three months and learn as much as I can about coding. I'm using this blog to reinforce what I learn by documenting it.

Writing about confusing concepts forces me to work through each step. It has proven the best tool I've found to identify the concepts that I don't understand as well as I might otherwise think that I do.

I also use this as a way to beat a path through some of the yak shaving, and leave a trail to follow the next time that same yak needs shaving.

I use [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to generate my blog pages. It takes care of all of the HTML and CSS, and has made making this blog incredibly easy.

I went to the GitHub repo linked above, and followed the instructions there.
