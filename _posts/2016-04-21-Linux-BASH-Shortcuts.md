title: Linux BASH Shortcuts
---

I have learned these useful terminal shortcuts. I use them a lot, so I’ll document them here:

**Ctrl+U**:
- Deletes the entire line you’re typing.
- Some documentation says that it cuts the text instead of just deleting it. I can’t paste it when I test this. I also haven’t run into a situation yet where I care whether I can paste what I just deleted.

**Ctrl+W**:
- Deletes the entire word before the cursor.
- I was trying Ctrl+Backspace with no luck.
- This also deletes any spaces that trail after the word.
