I’m a software developer and experienced language teacher.

My core experience is in Python, concentrating on natural language processing, as well as backend development in Node. At the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in NYC, a YC-backed programmer community, my projects include a [topic model generator](https://github.com/reeddunkle/Hacker_News_Article_Topics) using latent Dirichlet allocation and keyword extraction, an [in-browser game](https://github.com/reeddunkle/Speed_Pong) with physics simulation, and implementations of [engineering algorithms](https://github.com/reeddunkle/Backtrack_Robot).

I’ve been programming for most of my life. I graduated from Allegheny College where I studied Spanish, psychology, and Java.

I am using this blog to reinforce what I learn by documenting it here.

Writing about confusing concepts forces me to work through each step. It has proven the best tool I've found to identify the concepts that I don't understand and might otherwise think that I do.

I also use this as a way to beat a path through some of the yak shaving, and leave a trail to follow the next time that same yak needs shaving.

### Interests:

Aside from coding, I love music, education, and natural languages! I play the piano, bass guitar, and speak Spanish.
