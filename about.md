I am a hacker at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)

I am using this blog to reinforce what I learn at RC by documenting it here.

Writing about confusing concepts forces me to work through each step. It has proven the best tool I've found to identify the concepts that I don't understand as well as I might otherwise think that I do.

I also use this as a way to beat a path through some of the yak shaving, and leave a trail to follow the next time that same yak needs shaving.

### Interests:

I love coding, even the boring stuff. I get excited about:

- Language
- Current events
- Technology

I am enthusiastic about learning new things, and I try hard at learning.

### Background:

I am working to transition my career into programming after coming from an academic background in Spanish and translation.

- [Allegheny College](http://allegheny.edu/) in northwestern Pennsylvania
- [Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu/) in Vermont
