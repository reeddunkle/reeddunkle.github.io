My name is Reed Dunkle. I am a [competent](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex52.html) Python beginner developer, currently in residence at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (formerly [Hacker School](https://d29xw0ra2h4o4u.cloudfront.net/assets/instagram_22-535408341d14d3872ee06066f72c78d4d7393667e4b937d3f02007fd203ffa45.jpg)).

### Interests:

I love coding, even the boring stuff. I get excited about:
- Language
- Current events
- Technology

I am enthusiastic about learning new things, and I try hard at learning.

### Background:

I am working to transition my career into programming after coming from an academic background in Spanish and translation ([Allegheny College](http://allegheny.edu/) in Pennsylvania, and [Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu/#story513416) in Vermont.)
